# Capstone-Project from the "neuefische" CGN-WEB-22-1 Course !

## Project's Title

Worducation

## The App uses the following technologies:

- next.js + React
- Styled-Components
  - CSS in JS
- Jest
  - writing unit tests

## Code Instructions

You can clone the repository to a specific folder and open it in an editor of your choice. Then just run "npm i", followed by "npm run dev" to start the server and you can
study the code or just play the game!

## Functionality of the Game:

The App is an quiz game, where the player has to guess single letters to complete the full word.

A timer counts down to zero, which gives a limited amount of time.

Time is added for every correct guessed letter (colored green) and substracted for every wrong guessed letter (colored grey).

The category of questions can be chosen, before starting the game (e.g. Towns, Countries).

The game gets easier , the more playthroughs are done and the player gets better remembering the words of the category's collection.

## Why did i choose to make a Game like that:

I like geography and wanted to improve my knowledge of towns,
so i made this quiz to learn by repeating them in a vocabulary-learning and gamification style.
